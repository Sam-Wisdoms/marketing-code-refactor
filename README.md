This project is about a code refactor for a marketing agency's website to improve accessibility.
Heriseon is a marketing company that specializes in supporting other businesses to market their products.
With advent of new technologies and internet presence, competition is very high among businesses of all kinds.
This work was done with a goal of improving the company's code base so that when searches are made for marketing 
companies on the internet, Horiseon will pop up among the top 5.

grouping of elements, targeting of various and during syncing processes. 
In order to achieve the project goals, various activities were implementend in order to accomplish the user story and

The page have been given a unique title to ensure that it is optimized for search engines.
The agencies code base refactored to follow semantic HTML and acceptable standards.  
I have ensured that the code based followed logical structure and is independent of styling and positioning.
All image attributes have been assigned an alt attribute ensuring that various images are identifiable.
All heading attributes have been rearranged in sequential order and tags grouped appropriately.
